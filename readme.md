Tympan Library
===========================

**Purpose**: This library allows you to program your own audio processing algorithms for the Tympan!  It owes a big debt to the [Teensy Audio Library](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.html) and all of its contributors.

Requirements
------------

**Hardware**: This library is intended to be used to program a Teensy 3.6 that is connected to a Tympan Audio Board.  If you have a Typman in its nice black case, you have all the hardware that you need!

**Arduino IDE**:  To program the Tympan, you need to download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).  Download the acutal Arduino IDE, don't use the online web-based editor.  

**Teensyduino Add-On**:  After installing the Arduino IDE, you need to download and install the [Teensyduino Add-On](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html), which allows you to program the Teensy using the Arduino IDE. It'll ask you whether you want to install a bunch of libraries.  You can say "yes" to them all, or you can say "yes" to just a few (like Audio, Bounce2, FreqCount, FreqMeasure, i2c_t3, SerialFlash, Snooze, and SPIFlash).  It's your choice.

Installing the Tympan Library
------------

**Know GitHub?***:  If you know GitHub, go ahead and fork this repo and clone it to your local computer.  I strongly recommend that you clone it directly to the place on your computer where the Arduino IDE looks for libraries.  On my computer, I put them here: `C:\Users\chipaudette\Documents\Arduino\libraries\Tympan_Library`

**Don't Know GitHub?**: If you don't know GitHub, no problem!  You can download this library as a ZIP file.  Go back to the root of the Tympan library ([here](https://github.com/Tympan/Tympan_Library)) and click on the green button that says "Clone or Download".  You can then select "Download Zip".  Once the download is complete, I'd unzip the files and put them where the Arduino IDE looks for libraries.  On my computer, I put them here: `C:\Users\chipaudette\Documents\Arduino\libraries\Tympan_Library`
