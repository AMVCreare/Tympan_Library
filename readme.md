Tympan Library for Arduino/Teensy
===========================

**Purpose**: The purpose of this library is to build upon the [Teensy Audio Library](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.html) to enable new functionality for real-time audio processing.

**Approach**: I am attempting to follow the structure and approach of the Teensy Audio Library so that coding techniques, style, and structure that works for the Teensy Audio Library will also work with my library.  

**Send Help!**:  If you see ways to make this code better, go ahead and fork the repo, mod the code, and send a pull request!


Installation
------------

Download (and unzip) this library into the Arduino libraries directory on your computer.  On my computer, that means I put it here:

`C:\Users\chipaudette\Documents\Arduino\libraries\Tympan_Library`

Restart your Arduino IDE and you should now see this libraries example sketches under File->Examples->Tympan_Library
